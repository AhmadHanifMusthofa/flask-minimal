# flask-minimal

A minimal Flask starter project designed to help you quickly set up a clean, simple, and efficient web application. This project is structured to keep things lightweight and focuses on productivity, with all your code contained in a single file (`app.py`), along with basic templates and static assets.

## Preparation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y

## Features
- Single-file Flask application (`app.py`) to maximize productivity and simplicity.
- Basic HTML template structure with minimal styling and JavaScript.
- Simple and intuitive project setup with no unnecessary complexity.
- Easily customizable for rapid development of web applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-minimal.git
   cd flask-minimal
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   python app.py
   ```

The Flask app will start, and you can view it by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Usage

This starter project is ready to be used as a foundation for building web applications. The app.py file contains all the Flask routes and logic, making it simple to expand and customize. You can add more templates, routes, or static files as needed.

## Customization
You can easily modify:

 - The HTML structure in `templates/index.html`
 - The styling in `static/style.css`
 - The interactivity in `static/script.js`
